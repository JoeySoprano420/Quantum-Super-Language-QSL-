### Walkthrough

#### Creating Your First QSL Program

1. **Create a New Project**:
   - In your terminal, create a new directory for your project:
     ```sh
     mkdir MyFirstQSLProject
     cd MyFirstQSLProject
     ```

2. **Write Your First QSL Script**:
   - Create a new file named `main.qsl` and open it in your favorite text editor.
   - Write the following code:
     ```qsl
     // Import standard library
     import std.io

     // Main function
     function main() {
         print("Hello, Quantum Super Language!")
     }

     // Execute main function
     main()
     ```

3. **Run Your QSL Program**:
   - In the terminal, run your script:
     ```sh
     qsl main.qsl
     ```
   - You should see the output:
     ```

     ```

### About QSL

QSL is a versatile programming language designed to unify the performance and robustness of Fortran with the flexibility and ease of JavaScript. It caters to a wide range of domains, providing specialized libraries and tools to streamline development processes.

### Detailed Examples

#### Example 1: Image Processing

**Image Resizing and Filtering**:
```qsl
import media.image

let img = media.image.load("photo.jpg")
img = media.image.resize(img, 800, 600)
img = media.image.apply_filter(img, "sepia")
media.image.save(img, "photo_sepia.jpg")
```

#### Example 2: Marketing Analytics

**Track and Analyze Campaign**:
```qsl
import marketing.analytics

let campaign = marketing.analytics.create_campaign("Summer Sale", 10000)
let data = marketing.analytics.track_performance(campaign.id)
let analysis = marketing.analytics.analyze_data(data)

print("Campaign Analysis: ", analysis)
```

#### Example 3: Logistics and Travel

**Route Planning and Shipment Tracking**:
```qsl
import logistics.travel

let route = logistics.travel.plan_route("New York", "Los Angeles")
print("Planned Route: ", route)

let shipmentStatus = logistics.travel.track_shipment("12345")
print("Shipment Status: ", shipmentStatus)
```

let summary = data.datasets.summarize(filteredData)

print("Data Summary: ", summary)
```

#### Concurrency and Parallelism

**Concurrent Task Execution**:
```qsl
import std.concurrent

function task1() {
    // Task 1 logic
}

function task2() {
    // Task 2 logic
}

std.concurrent.parallel_execute([task1, task2])
```
